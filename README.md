# Synchronous-FIFO

This project implements a Synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) queue in Verilog HDL. 
The module is parameterized for flexibility in data width and depth.

Verification of Synchronous FIFO (Testbench Design): Created a comprehensive Verilog testbench to verify the functionality of a parameterized synchronous FIFO module.
                                                     The testbench includes randomized data input generation.
